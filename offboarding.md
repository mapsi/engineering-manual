# Offboarding

When offboarding an employee, prioritize the revocation of access to ensure data security. Follow these steps in order of severity:

1. Remove Google Workspace access by suspending the user.

2. Revoke AWS access.

3. Revoke GCP access.
Since GCP is using Google Workspace for authentication, access will be disabled from step 1.
4. Disable Github access by removing the user.

You need to go to Settings â†’ Members â†’ Access Level.
6. Disable account on Slack
